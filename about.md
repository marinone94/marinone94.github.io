Hello! I am glad you ended up here! Let me share a few words about myself.

### More Information
As explained in the blog page, the goal is to give back a little bit of what I got from the ML, software, infrastructure, and data communities.
This is a journey for me, and I will do tons of mistakes. Only through your feedbacks, things can improve. Self-supervised learning is great, but as I don't have access to TBs of data (nor the computational capacity to process it) a bit of supervision won't harm.
